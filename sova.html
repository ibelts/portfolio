        <h4 class="sectionTitle1">Problem</h4>
        <p class="textP">Most Russian-speaking parents want their children to be able to speak their heritage language and regularly read books in Russian with them. Finding these books in the US is challenging. There are almost no local stores that offer literature in Russian so people usually have to order books online from Russian stores and pay for extremely expensive shipping. Children (especially younger) prefer to read paper books with large illustrations, so online books don’t work. The Russian community is in need of a reliable source of paper books for their children. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="solutionGrid">
          <h4 class="sectionTitle2">Solution</h4>
          <p class="textP">Sova is a free platform that allows people located in the RTP to exchange their books with others. Parents can create an account and list children’s paper books in Russian they would like to lend as well as search for books they would like to borrow. Using the platform they can keep track of books they are lending or borrowing and communicate with borrowers or book owners via a built-in Facebook messenger. Sova offers a powerful search as well as an opportunuty to browse the catalog of available books. The platform provides Russian parents with a reliable source of  books in Russian for their children.</p>

              <p>A majority of book sharing apps offer only e-books. Surprisingly, there are basically no solutions for creating a private library that would work with paper books. At the moment there’s one app that allows lending and borrowing paper books available across all cities in the US (Boocshare), one app is available in 8 US cities (Peerby, a platform for exchanging anything, including books). Other platforms for borrowing/lending books are not available in the US (such as ChapterOne).

                                    <p>Libre Baskerville is a serif typeface based on the Baskerville font family that was originally designed by the American Type Founders (ATF) in 1841. Like the original Baskerville, Libre Baskerville still gives an impression of a font family from the storybook, which perfectly aligns with the semantics of our app, while it is fully adapted for the use on a screen. Nunito is a legible sans serif font with rounded shapes that works well for the body text. Nunito and Libre Baskerville is a perfect pairing with just enough contrast while typefaces still work in unison. </p>

                                <p class="conclP1">Sova was a passion project for me because I have strong empathy for parents who are trying to help their children to learn their heritage language. A platform for exchanging children's’ paper books in Russian is a much-needed product in the Russian community in North Carolina.
                                </p>
                                <p class="conclP2">While working on the app I reached out to North Carolinian Russian-speaking parents and enjoyed working with them. I was amazed by their readiness to participate in user research, preference tests, and usability tests. Involving users at any stage of the digital product design is priceless.
                                </p>
                                <p class="conclP3">Through numerous design iterations, user research, and usability tests I created a usable UI that is easy to navigate. Sova accomplishes its goal to give parents of bilingual children a convenient way to exchange paper books in Russian.
